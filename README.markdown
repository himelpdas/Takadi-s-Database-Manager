This is a simple project I helped create for a friend at [NYIT](http://nyit.edu). The project manages the costumes, customers, and rentals of a simple fictional store called _Takadi's_. The project is built with [web2py](http://web2py.org) and demonstrates web2py's powerful Database Abstraction Layer, as well as its powerful _SQLFORM.grid_ CRUD tool. The project was completed by the students under my guidance just in under a day. Below is the project's description and screenshots of the website:
