#NYIT Fall 2016 Software Engineering Topics
##Takadi's

As a tutor, one of my pupils approached me for guidance with his software engineering senior undergraduate project at [NYIT](http://nyit.edu). I directed the pupil and his team to complete this project in just under a day. The project manages the costumes, customers, and rentals of a simple fictional store called _Takadi's_. The project is built with [web2py](http://web2py.org) and demonstrates web2py's powerful Database Abstraction Layer, as well as its powerful _SQLFORM.grid_ CRUD tool. Below is the project's description and screenshots of the website:
